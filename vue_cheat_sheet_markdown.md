# Directives

### Directives are attributes identified by the v- prefix.
```v-text``` uses the property as the text value of the element
```v-html``` uses the property as the text value of the element, interpreting HTML
```v-if``` show an element only if the conditional is true
```v-else``` shows an alternative element if the preceding v-if is false
```v-else-if``` adds an else if block for a v-if construct
```v-show``` similar to ```v-if```, but adds the element to the DOM even if falsy. Just sets it to ```display: none```.
```v-for``` iterates over an array or iterable object   
```v-on``` 	listen to DOM events   
```v-bind``` reactively update an HTML attribute   
```v-model``` sets up a two-way binding for form inputs. used in form elements, updates the model when the user changes the form field value   
```v-once``` applies the property just once, and never refreshes it even if the data passed changes

```v-bind``` and ```v-on``` have a shorthand format:   
``` html
<a v-bind:href="url">...</a>
<a :href="url">...</a>
```
```html
<a v-on:click="doSomething">...</a>
<a @click="doSomething">...</a>
```
Example of ```v-if``` / ```v-else``` / ```v-else-if```:
```html
<div v-if="type === 'A'">
  it's A
</div>
<div v-else-if="type === 'B'">
  it's B
</div>
<div v-else-if="type === 'C'">
  it's C
</div>
<div v-else>
  it's neither one
</div>
```

### Conditionals
You can embed a conditional in an expression using the ternary operator:
```JavaScript
{{ isTrue ? 'yes' : 'no' }}
```

### Working with form elements
To make the model update when the change event occurs, and not any time the user presses a key, you can use ```v-model.lazy``` instead of just ```v.model```.

Working with input fields, ```v-model.trim``` is useful because it automatically removes whitespace.

And if you accept a number instead than a string, make sure you use ```v-model.number```.

### Modifying events
I use ```click``` as an example, but applies to all possible events

```v-on:click.native``` trigger a native DOM event instead of a Vue event
```v-on:click.stop``` stop the click event propagation
```v-on:click.passive``` makes use of the passive option of addEventListener
```v-on:click.capture``` use event capturing instead of event bubbling
```v-on:click.self``` make sure the click event was not bubbled from a child event, but directly happened on that element
```v-on:click.once``` the event will only be triggered exactly once
```v-on:submit.prevent```: call event.preventDefault() on the triggered submit event, used to avoid a form submit to reload the page

### Mouse event modifiers
```v-on:click .left``` triggers only on left mouse button click
```v-on:click .right``` triggers only on right mouse button click
```v-on:click .middle``` triggers only on middle mouse button click

### Submit an event only if a particular key is pressed
```v-on:keyup.enter```
```v-on:keyup.tab```
```v-on:keyup.delete```
```v-on:keyup.esc```
```v-on:keyup.up```
```v-on:keyup.down```
```v-on:keyup.left```
```v-on:keyup.right```

### Keyboard event modifiers
Only trigger the event if a particular keyboard key is also pressed:
```ctrl```
```alt```
```shift```
```meta``` (cmd on Mac, windows key on Win)

##### v-bind
```v-bind .prop``` bind a prop instead of an attribute
```v-bind .camel``` use camelCase for the attribute name
```v-bind .sync``` a syntactic sugar that expands into a v-on handler for updating the bound value.

### Lifecycle Hooks
```beforeCreate``` called before the app is created
```created``` called after the app is created
```beforeMount``` called before the app is mounted on the DOM
```mounted``` called after the app is mounted on the DOM
```beforeDestroy``` called before the app is destroyed
```destroyed``` called after the app is destroyed
```beforeUpdate``` called before a property is updated
```updated``` called after a property is updated
```activated``` called when a kept-alive component is activated
```deactivated``` called when a kept-alive component is deactivated

### Built-in components
Vue provides 5 built-in components:
```<component>```
```<transition>```
```<transition-group>```
```<keep-alive>```
```<slot>```

### Global Configuration of the Vue object
The ```Vue.config``` object has these properties, which you can modify when you create the instance:

```silent``` defaults to false, if true suppress logs and warnings
```optionMergeStrategies``` allows to define a custom merging strategy for options
```devtools``` defaults to true in development, and false in production. You can override those values.
```errorHandler``` allows to set an error handler function. Useful to hook Sentry and other similar services
```warnHandler``` allows to set a warning handler function, similar to ```errorHandler```, but for warnings instead of errors
```ignoredElements``` used to let Vue ignore custom elements defined outside of it, like Web Components.
```keyCodes``` let you define custom key aliases for v-on
```performance``` defaults to false. If set to true, traces the performance of Vue components in the Browser DevTools.
```productionTip``` defaults to true. Set to false to disable the warning “you’re in development mode” during development in the console.

### Methods of the Vue object
```Vue.extend``` 	allows to subclass the Vue object, to create a custom profile
```Vue.nextTick``` 	defers the callback to be executed after the next DOM update cycle
```Vue.set``` 	add a property to the object
```Vue.delete``` 	delete a property from the object
```Vue.directive``` 	set (or get) a global directive
```Vue.filter``` 	set (or get) a global filter
```Vue.component``` 	set (or get) a global component
```Vue.use``` 	install a Vue.js plugin
```Vue.mixin``` 	set a global mixin
```Vue.compile``` 	compile a template string into a render function
```Vue.version``` 	returns the currently installed version of Vue

### Options passed to a Vue object
When initializing a Vue object, you pass in an object:
```javascript
const vm = new Vue({

})
```
This object accepts a number of properties.

```data``` allows to pass a set of reactive data that will be used by the Vue app. All reactive ```properties``` must be added at initialization time, you can’t add new ones later.
```props``` 	it’s a set of attributes that are exposed to parent components as input data.
```propsData``` 	default data for props. Only useful during testing
```methods``` 	a set of methods that are defined on the Vue instance
```computed``` 	like methods, but cached internally
```watch``` 	allows to watch properties, and call a function when they change

Example of defining data, methods and computed properties:
``` javascript
var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#example',
  
  data: {
    message: 'Hello'
  },
  
  methods: {
    reverseMessageAsMethod() {
      return this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  },
  
  computed: {
    // a computed getter
    reversedMessage() {
      return this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
})
```
### DOM
```el``` sets the DOM element where the instance mounts on. It can be a CSS Selector, or an HTMLElement
```template``` is a template, represented as a string, that will replace the mounted element
```render``` alternatively to define the template, you can define a template using a render function
```renderError``` set an alternative output when the function attached to ```render``` fails

### Vue instance assets
```directives``` the set of directives to associate to the Vue instance
```filters``` the set of filters to associate to the Vue instance
```components``` the set of components to associate to the Vue instance

### Vue composition options
```parent``` specifies the parent instance
```mixins``` sets an array of mixin objects
```extends``` extend another component

### Other Vue object options
```name``` setting a name to the component lets you invoke it, useful in debugging or when you need to recursively add a component in its template
```functional``` if true, sets the component to be stateless (no ```data```) and instanceless (no ```this```), making it more lightweight
```model``` allows to customize the property used in events, useful for example when interacting with forms
```comments``` defaults to false. If set to true, retains the HTML comments that are put in templates

### Instance properties
Given an instance of Vue, stored into a variable ```const vm = new Vue(/*...*/)```, you can inspect and interact with it.

### Properties of a Vue instance
```vm.$data``` the data object associated to the instance
```vm.$props``` the props the instance has received
```vm.$el``` the DOM element to which the instance is bound
```vm.$options``` the object used to instantiate the Vue instance
```vm.$parent``` the parent instance
```vm.$root``` the root instance (if this is the root instance, this points to itself)
```vm.$children``` an array of children instances
```vm.$slots``` an array of the associated slots contained in the template
```vm.$scopedSlots``` an array of the associated scoped slots
```vm.$refs``` an object that contains a property for each element pointed by a ```ref``` attribute defined in the template
```vm.$isServer``` true if the Vue instance is running on the server (useful in server-side rendering)
```vm.$attrs``` an object of attributes that are provided to the component but not defined as props
```vm.$listeners``` an object of ```v-on``` event listeners assigned to the component

### Methods Data
```vm.$watch``` set up a watcher for property changes in the Vue data. It can also watch for value changes inside objects
```vm.$set``` set a property
```vm.$delete``` delete a property

### Events
```vm.$emit``` triggers a custom event on the ```vm``` Vue instance
```vm.$on``` listen for a custom event on the ```vm``` Vue instance
```vm.$once``` like ```$on```, but listens only once
```vm.$off``` removes an event listener from the Vue instance

### Lifecycle Methods
```vm.$mount``` mount a Vue instance on a DOM element, in case it was not mounted yet
```vm.$forceUpdate``` force the ```vm``` Vue instance to re-render. Does not force child components to rerender.
```vm.$nextTick``` accepts a callback and schedules that for the next DOM update cycle
```vm.$destroy``` destroys the application and remove all child components, observers and listeners
